    ">The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.  Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",

    ">In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were more likely to survive. \n",

    "we expect that the accuracy is going to increase by implementing the L2 Regulizer due to the compensation of the best parameter of $\\lambda$ (or C) and computing the Loss error which should have better results for less number of samples. It means by using the Regularization the difference between test and training error should decrease.\n",

    "There is not a big differences for the training error with regularization and without the regularization (but with redoing the algorithm which leads to have different samples for training due to the permutaion)"
