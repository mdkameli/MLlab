    "# Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you need to use polynomial regression to estimate the height reached by a ball thrown into air. The motion of the ball is controlled by the motion equation with uniform acceleration (in our case given by the gravity) that is a quadratic model. You need to estimate the initial height of the ball (h), the initial speed at which it was launched (v) and the gravity acceleration (g). The equation of the motion is : $y = h + vt + \\frac{1}{2} gt^2$ .\n",
    "In the height.csv file you can find the measured height values (subject to noise) while in time.csv file you can find the corresponding time instants."
